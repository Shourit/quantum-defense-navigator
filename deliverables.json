  "test_steps": [
    "1. Navigate to https://quantum-defense-navigator.vercel.app/",
    "2. Verify AI Assistant appears as compact card in top-right sidebar (380px width)",
    "3. Confirm only 4 example chips visible, wrapped in 2 rows",
    "4. Check Verbosity and Tone dropdowns are side-by-side",
    "5. Verify placeholder text 'AI response will appear here.' shows initially",
    "6. Enter a query and click Submit to test response area",
    "7. After response, verify quick action buttons (Sum, Act, JSON) appear compactly",
    "8. Scroll down to confirm AI assistant stays sticky at top-right",
    "9. Verify Top 5 High Risks panel appears below AI assistant in same right column",
    "10. Navigate to non-existent route to verify 404 page link works"

    "Only first 4 example chips shown to save space, truncated at 35 chars",
    "Quick action button labels abbreviated (Summarize→Sum, Extract Actions→Act, Export JSON→JSON)",
    "handleSubmit function reuses existing onSubmit prop flow - actual edge function integration needed",
    "All links previously audited, no new broken links found in codebase"
