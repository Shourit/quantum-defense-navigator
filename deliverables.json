    "All demo mode code clearly marked with '// DEMO MODE - NO EXTERNAL CALLS' comments",
    "To replace with real LLM: swap streamDemoResponse in UserInteraction.tsx with actual edge function call to /api/chat endpoint",

    "Quick action buttons hidden until response completes",

  "test_steps": [
    "1. Navigate to https://quantum-defense-navigator.vercel.app/",
    "2. Verify AI Assistant appears as compact card in top-right sidebar with 'demo mode' badge",
    "3. Confirm all 6 example chips visible and wrap properly without mid-word truncation",
    "4. Click an example chip → verify input fills → click Submit",
    "5. Observe streaming response with cursor animation",
    "6. After streaming completes, verify Quick Action buttons (Sum, Act, JSON) appear",
    "7. Scroll down to Quantum Attack Simulation section",
    "8. Click 'Run New Simulation' → verify 900ms loading state → confirm chart updates and 'Simulation finished' toast",
    "9. Scroll to AI Migration Orchestrator section",
    "10. Click 'Start Migration' on any task → verify button shows 'Starting...' → confirm status changes to MIGRATING with ETA",
    "11. Resize browser window to < 360px to verify responsive chip behavior",
    "12. Check that all demo actions show 'Demo mode' or 'Demo action' labels"

  "assumptions": [
    "QUASAR_Test_Data.csv is available for risk panel data; demoClient.ts uses static contextual keywords as fallback",
    "All demo responses are deterministic based on verbosity + tone inputs",
    "Streaming chunks are 180-300ms apart to simulate realistic AI response timing",
    "Migration progress starts at 5% when 'MIGRATING' status is set",
    "Simulation data uses fixed base vulnerability scores + small random variance for visual variety",
    "No backend or database changes - all state updates are client-side React state only"
